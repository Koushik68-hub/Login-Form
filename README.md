This project is a simple Login Form created using HTML for structure and CSS for styling. A login form is an essential component of almost every website and web application, as it allows users to enter their credentials (username and password) and access restricted or personalized areas of the system.
HTML5 – for creating the form structure, labels, and input fields.
CSS3 – for designing and styling the form to make it visually appealing.
